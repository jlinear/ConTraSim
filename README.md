# ConTraSim: Contextual Trajectory Generator

This repository stores the source code and some sample date for the ConTraG.

- ToC and Intro sections to be continued.


src: all source code
data: inputs and intermediate data (map, sumocfg, etc.)
output: the final output of trajectory dataset


## User profile modeling

### daily routing extraction


### transport mode classification


### trip formation


### routing strategies


## Output Formatting


### time alignment


### geo-location adjustment

### data

#### map

- **\*.osm.xml**: Raw OpenStreetMap data directly extracted/downloaded from <https://www.openstreetmap.org/>
- **\*.net.xml**: SUMO-readable network file that can be used by SUMO software series, generated by SUMO netconvert program using *\*.osm.xml*
- **\*.poly.xml**: SUMO-readable polygon file that mainly describes the building shapes and certian areas, generated by SUMO polyconvert program using *\*.osm.xml*
- **\*.netccfg**: netconvert configuration file, the file is generated when running the SUMO netconvert program, and is simply a copy of the configurations being fed into netconvert. The purpose is to keep a record and make the netcovert process repeatable.
- **\*.polycfg**: polyconvert configuration file, generated and saved when running the SUMO polyconvert program.
<!-- - **\*.adjusted_poly.add.xml**: mannually adjusted polygon file based on *\*.poly.xml* -->
 the one that will be used for next steps: ".net.xml"

### src

- **map.builder.py**: map extractor and network builder relyingon OpenStreetMap
- **get_taz.py**: translate predefined stops or clusters to Traffic Analysis Zones (TAZs)
